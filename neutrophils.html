    <h1>Neutrophils</h1>

    <p>Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell (WBC or granulocyte) that protect us from infections, among other functions. They are the most abundant (making up approximately 40 percent to 60 percent of the white blood cells in our bodies) type of white blood cells in most mammals.  A normal neutrophil count is between 2500 and 7500 neutrophils per microliter of blood. The neutrophil count may be high with infections, due to increased production in the bone marrow as with leukemia, or due to physical or emotional stress. A low number of neutrophils may also be a sign of disease in conditions such as leukemia, some infections, vitamin B12 deficiency, chemotherapy, and more.They form an essential part of the innate immune system, with their functions varying in different animals.</p>

    <p>They are formed from stem cells in the bone marrow and differentiated into subpopulations of neutrophil-killers and neutrophil-cagers. They are short-lived and highly motile, or mobile, as they can enter parts of tissue where other cells/molecules cannot. Neutrophils may be subdivided into segmented neutrophils and banded neutrophils (or bands). They form part of the polymorphonuclear cell family (PMNs) together with basophils and eosinophils.</p>
        
    <p>The name neutrophil derives from staining characteristics on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histological or cytological preparations. Whereas basophilic white blood cells stain dark blue and eosinophilic white blood cells stain bright red, neutrophils stain a neutral pink. Normally, neutrophils contain a nucleus divided into 2â€“5 lobes.</p>
        
    <p>These are the first cells to arrive on the scene when we experience a bacterial infection. Neutrophils are recruited to the site of injury within minutes following trauma and are the hallmark of acute inflammation; however, due to some pathogens being indigestible, they can be unable to resolve certain infections without the assistance of other types of immune cells.</p>
    <p>Neutrophils address foreign invaders by "eating them" a process referred to as <a href=phagocytosis.html>phagocytosis</a>, or by taking them up into the cell in a process called endocytosis</p><br>
