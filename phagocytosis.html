    <h1>Phagocytosis</h1>
    <p class="unique">Phagocytosis is the process that macrophages and other phagocytes like neutrophils use in order to destroy pathogens. What happens is once they've recognize the pathogen, they start to wrap their cell membrane around the pathogen and absorb them to within their cell. The pathogen is then left inside the phagosome and this fuses with the surrounding lysosomes that provide digestive enzymes that then break down that pathogen, destroying it and also processing all of their components into harmless waste products. Phagocytosis differs from other methods of endocytosis because it is very specific and depends on the cell being able to bind to the item it wants to engulf by way of cell surface receptors. Phagocytosis won’t happen unless the cell is in physical contact with the particle it wants to engulf.

    <h1>The process of Phagocytosis</h1>

        <li>Contact of virus and cell</li>
        <img style="float:left; margin:10px; width:340px" src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/phagocytosis-160103124248/95/phagocytosis-8-638.jpg?cb=1489738835">
        <p>Sometimes the immune cell accidentally bumps into a virus in the blood stream. Other times, cells move by chemotaxis. Chemotaxis is the movement of phagocytes toward an increasing concentration of some attractant such as bacterial factors (bacterial proteins, capsules, LPS, peptidoglycan, teichoic acids, etc.), complement proteins (C5a), chemokines (chemotactic cytokines such as interleukin-8 secreted by various cells), fibrin split products, kinins, and phospholipids released by injured host cells. However, some microbes, such as the influenza A viruses, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, blood invasive strains of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Bordetella pertussis have been shown to block chemotaxis. Many immune system cells move in response to cytokines, small proteins used specifically for cell signaling. Cytokines signal cells to move to certain area in the body where the virus is found. This is common with infections that are specific to a certain area (like a skin wound infected with bacteria).</p>
        <li>Binding of virus to surface receptors</li>
        <img style="float:right; margin:10px; width:450px" src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/courses-images/wp-content/uploads/sites/1094/2016/11/10192504/OSC_Microbio_17_04_PRR1.jpg">
        <p>Different cell types express different receptors. Some receptors are general, meaning that they can identify a self-produced molecule versus a potential threat (and that’s about it), and others are very specific, like toll-like receptors or antibodies. The macrophage will not initiate phagocytosis without successful binding of the cell surface receptors.</p>
        <p>Viruses can also have surface receptors which can be specific to those on the macrophage. Viruses need to access the host cell’s cytoplasm or nucleus in order to replicate and cause an infection, so they use their surface receptors to interact with immune system cells and exploit the immune response for entry into the cell. Sometimes, when a virus and a host cell interact, the host cell is able to successfully destroy the virus and stop the spread of infection. Other times, the host cell engulfs the virus, and the virus tricks the cell, gaining access to what it needs to replicate. Once this happens, the infected cell is identified and destroyed by other cells of the immune system in order to stop viral replication and infection.</p>
        <p>A phagocyte has many types of receptors on its surface that are used to bind material. They include opsonin receptors, scavenger receptors, and Toll-like receptors. Opsonin receptors increase the phagocytosis of bacteria that have been coated with immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies or with complement. "Complement" is the name given to a complex series of protein molecules found in the blood that destroy cells or mark them for destruction. Scavenger receptors bind to a large range of molecules on the surface of bacterial cells, and Toll-like receptors—so called because of their similarity to well-studied receptors in fruit flies that are encoded by the Toll gene—bind to more specific molecules. Binding to Toll-like receptors increases phagocytosis and causes the phagocyte to release a group of hormones that cause inflammation.</p>
        <li>Engulfment of pathogen</li>

        <p>Instead of moving the large item across the plasma membrane, which might damage the membrane permanently, phagocytosis uses extensions of the cytoplasm (pseudopods) to surround the particle and enclose it in a membrane. The speed with which a phagocytic cell ingests a particle varies somewhat with the size of the particle. Small particles, such as bacteria or minute grains of charcoal, are ingested almost instantaneously. Larger objects, such as clumps of bacteria or tissue cells, are phagocytosed over the course of a more-prolonged response. The cell flows around the object until it has been completely engulfed. The engulfed object is thus enclosed within a membrane-bound vacuole called a phagosome. The phagocyte digests the ingested particle with hydrolytic enzymes, which are contained within membrane-enclosed sacs called lysosomes found within the cell. Phagocytic enzymes are secreted into the vacuole in which digestion takes place. Small organic components of the particle are used to build larger molecules needed by the cell.</p>
        <li>Enclosure in phagosome</li>
        <img style="float:right; margin:10px; width:400px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e6/Phagocytosis2.png">
        <p>Phagocytosis consists in recognition and ingestion of particles larger than 0.5 μm into a plasma membrane derived vesicle, known as phagosome. The lips of the pocket, formed as a result of the extensions of the pseudopods extending towards each other in order to close the gap. This action creates a phagosome, where the plasma membrane has moved around the particle, encasing it safely inside the cell.</p>
        <p>While in all instances phago- cytosis is manifested as the enclosure of a particle within an endomembrane vacuole, it is important to consider that phago- somes formed by the various receptor–ligand pairs may have divergent fates. Supporting this view, FcγR-derived, but not CR3-derived, phagosomes containing Salmonella fuse with se- cretory granules in neutrophils. Similarly, only IgG- opsonized Mycobacteria, but not those entering the cells via complement receptors, can fuse with lysosomes. Thus not all phagosomes are created equal.</p>
        <li>Fusion with lysosomes(phagolysosome)</li>
        <p class=>Lysosomes are also bubble-like structures, similar to phagosomes, which process wastes inside the cell. “Lysis” means “to break down”, making it easy to remember the function of a lysosome. Without fusing with a lysosome, the phagosome wouldn’t be able to do anything with the contents inside.</p>
        <p class="different">In biology, a phagolysosome, or endolysosome, is a cytoplasmic body formed by the fusion of a phagosome with a lysosome in a process that occurs during phagocytosis. Formation of phagolysosomes is essential for the intracellular destruction of microorganisms and pathogens. 
        It takes place when the phagosome's and lysosome's membranes 'collide', at which point the lysosomal contents—including hydrolytic enzymes—are discharged into the phagosome in an explosive manner and digest the particles that the phagosome had ingested. Some products of the digestion are useful materials and are moved into the cytoplasm; others are exported by exocytosis.</p>
        <p class="different">Membrane fusion of the phagosome and lysosome is regulated by the Rab5 protein, a G protein that allows the exchange of material between these two organelles but prevents complete fusion of their membranes.</p>

        <li>Lowering of pH to break down content</li>
        <p class="different">Phagolysosomes function by reducing the pH of their internal environment thus making them acidic. This serves as a defense mechanism against microbes and other harmful parasites and also provides a suitable medium for degradative enzyme activity.</p>
        <p class="different">Microbes are destroyed within phagolysosomes by a combination of oxidative and non-oxidative processes. The oxidative process also known as respiratory burst includes the "non-mitochondrial" production of reactive oxygen species.</p>      
        <p class=>By lowering pH and concentrations of sources of carbon and nitrogen, phagolysomes inhibit growth of fungi. An example is the inhibition of hyphae in Candida albicans.</p>       
        <p class=>In human neutrophils, the phagolysosomes destroy pathogens also by producing hypochlorous acid.</p>
        <p>Some viruses actually exploit the lowered pH to escape the phagolysosome and start replicating inside the cell. For example, influenza (the flu virus) uses the drop in pH to activate a conformational change, allowing it to escape into the cytoplasm.</p>
        <li>Residual body with phagolysosome wastes</li>
        <p>Once the contents have been neutralized, the phagolysosome forms a residual body that contains the waste products from the phagolysosome. The residual body is eventually discharged from the cell.</p>
