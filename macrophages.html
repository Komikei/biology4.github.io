    <h2>What are macrophages?</h2>

    <p>A macrophage is a large white blood cell that is an important part of our immune system. The word 'macrophage' literally means 'big eater.' It's an amoeba-like organism, and its job is to clean our body of microscopic debris and invaders. A macrophage has the ability to locate and 'eat' particles, such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites.</p>
    <p>Macrophages are born from white blood cells called monocytes, which are produced by stem cells in our bone marrow. Monocytes move through the bloodstream and when they leave the blood, they mature into macrophages. They live for months, patrolling our cells and organs and keeping them clean.</p>
    <p>After an infection, the innate system responds immediately and of which one of the first to respond are the macrophages.They recognize pathogens by specific characteristics that occur on the pathogens but don't occur on cells of the body. These charateristics are called pathogen associated molecular patterns(PAMPs). They recognize PAMPs using various receptor types including toll-like receptors.</p>
    <p>Macrophages accomplish their ongoing cleanup task by engulfing unwanted particles and 'eating' them. This process is called <a href=phagocytosis.html>phagocytosis</a><br>
